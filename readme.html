<h2>Story Overview</h2>
<p>Winter is a simple game about a nameless man who trying make his way home, but is forced to travel through dangerous mountains full of creatures and magic. Will he make his way to the other side?</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This game was originally created for a game jam (or compo as we called it) all the way back in 2003 using the ika game engine. It was built in about 3 weeks by a small but talented team. My main role then was with content creation, helping to create many of the maps that are in the game. The game was very ambitious - probably too much for the timeframe it had to work with. Though the game was finishable, there was a lot of planned content that didn't make the cut. And so I took it upon myself to finally complete the game - filling in some of that incomplete content, and adding in modern quality of life features: damage indicators, an automap, ability to set controls, vieiwng level up stats, implementing an additional skill, and a bit more gameplay balance. However one thing I couldn't really do was to increase the amount of enemies, so I apologize in advance for the lack of variety! But hopefully you will still enjoy the game. You can expect about 2 hours of gameplay, depending on your skill level and eye for exploration.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>The game supports both keyboard and gamepad controls. However, as its gamepad support is old it may not work on newer controllers. The controls can be configured in game, but here are the defaults for keyboard:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Arrow Keys</dt>
	<dd>Move the player, move the cursor in menus.</dd>
	<dt>Escape</dt>
	<dd>Opens the subscreen menu.</dd>
	<dt>Tab</dt>
	<dd>Open Automap</dd>
	<dt>Spacebar</dt>
	<dd>Attack with your sword.</dd>
	<dt>Z, X, C, V</dt>
	<dd>Use various skills that you will acquire over the course of your journey.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Things to Look out For</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Runes</dt>
	<dd>There are various runes you will find. Some increase your stats for defense, attack, and magic power. Others will give you permanent magic skills. These consume MP when used, and can be open up new areas to explore.</dd>
	<dt>TNT</dt>
	<dd>Some areas will be blocked off by boulders. These can be destroyed by TNT.</dd>
	<dt>Tents</dt>
	<dd>The mountains have tents scattered around - use them to save your game and heal!</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Kill enemies to gain EXP and level up to increase your MP, HP, and stats.</dt>
<dt>You will also acquire additional skills at certain points.</dt>
<dt>MP will regenerate overtime - increasing your Magic stat will increase your regeneration rate.</dt>
<dt>You can also gain a small amount of MP by killing enemies.</dt>
